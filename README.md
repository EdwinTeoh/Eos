## What is this? 
Eos Engine is a 3D game engine developed for the game Security Surge, which is a university project where I had to work with other programmers and designers to create a game and an engine from scratch. The project was developed over the course of about 6-7 months and the gameplay footage is in the repository.

## Notes
Visual Studio 2019 is recommended but the compilation of the project has to be done with the v142 Platform Toolset otherwise the project will not compile.
An executable has already been pre-prepared and it is located in the build directory.
